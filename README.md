# network-automation
Make repetitive and time consuming tasks easily with network automation. I am working with Cisco switches. Feel free to use the code as you want.

# createNetworkTopolgy
This script connects to the switches by using provided IP addresses, username, and password. It fetches CDP neighbor information. Create a topology that can be seen in a browser.

# getConfigBackups
This script connects to the switches by using provided IP addresses, username, and password. It fetches the full configuration and save it to a 'configBackups' folder.
